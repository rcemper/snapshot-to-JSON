This is a sample to use %JSON.Adaptor class available in IRIS  
to produce a snapshot of your object.  

The sample consists of 2 classes that are variations of what was  
known in CachÃ©/SAMPLES as Sample.Person.   
Be aware that the possibilities are limited by %JSON.Adapter   
and how you make use of it.   

Once in place you create some test data by Populate().  
You select an object and take a snapshot using %JSONExportToString();     

You apply changes to your object take another snapshot.
And see the difference.

For better visualization package #ZPretty# is applied 
BINGO!
